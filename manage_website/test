	<strong>Big Meet Sign-outs:&nbsp;</strong>Signing out of the meet automatically removes you from both days of the meet. &nbsp;To sign-out for a single day, email the <a href="mailto:swimwoodlands@gmail.com" style="font-size: 15px;">head coach</a>. &nbsp;If you sign-out for a single day, please double check posted entries to ensure your swimmers are not entered into a relay on a day they are unavailable, as this process can be prone to user error.

<p>
	<strong>Spot the W</strong> is a game we play each year as we get pumped up on the way to Heather Farms Pool. &nbsp;Kermit places a number of cardboard W signs (usually 5-15) on the drive between Woodlands and Heather Farms, starting at Ygnacio & Oak Grove all the way to the team area. &nbsp;Look high, look low, and play as a family to watch both sides of the road (drivers PLEASE drive safe). &nbsp;Find the last W (which counts) at the entry box in the team area; write down your swimmer's name and the number of W's they spotted on an entry for (or any piece of paper) and put it in the entry box for a chance to win prizes, from stickers to snow cones!

	*This sign-out deadline is for the purpose of determining relay entries, so that all relay participants who qualify can be notified prior to the Conference Meet, and we can not enter a relay (or get swimmers hopes up) if one or more relay members is unavailable. &nbsp;Individual entrants who qualify can be entered into the meet as late as the Monday after Conference.
